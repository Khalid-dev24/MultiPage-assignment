        <h1>About Precious Kiddies Academy</h1>

The founders, Mr. and Mrs. Adebiyi, started this institution with a passion for nurturing young minds, intending to create a “home away from home” for every child.
             What began with just ten students has flourished over the years, growing into a thriving academic community with over 150 students across preparatory, nursery, and primary school sections. <br>

This approach aims to foster intellectual curiosity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. <br>
