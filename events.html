            A vibrant celebration of diversity, where students dress in traditional attire, perform cultural dances, and learn about different heritages. This day fosters respect and appreciation for cultural diversity. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>2. Color Day:</strong>
            
            Students and staff dress in the color theme of the day, bringing fun and creativity into the school environment. Activities are centered around color recognition, art, and learning through visual experiences. <br>
